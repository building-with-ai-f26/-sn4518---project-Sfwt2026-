## 2026-11-13 — Claude Code: exercise catalog

**Done (commit `fd0bc1d`, branch `build-2-profile-onboarding`, not pushed):**
- `prototype/exercises.js` is a generated catalog of 120 exercises (97 strength, 15 stretches, 8 cardio), built from `data/exercises.json` (free-exercise-db, public domain) by `scripts/build-catalog.js` using `scripts/catalog-picks.txt`. Never edit `exercises.js` by hand.
- The coach (`prototype/coach.js`) picks 4 exercises per session from the catalog and swaps any the user's setup (full gym / home / limited machines) can't do.
- Tests: `node --test tests/` → 62 pass.

**Decisions made with the user:**
- Alternatives rule: same primary muscle, same push/pull, same compound/isolation. Equipment is NOT part of the rule; it only filters what the user can do. Same-equipment alternatives (e.g. flat vs incline dumbbell press) are valid but listed last.
- Equipment tags are physical items (e.g. "adjustable bench", "leg press machine"). One name per thing. Reason: a later build lets each user list 2–3 gym sites and the equipment at each, used as a filter.
- General muscle groups are fine (no upper/lower chest split).

**Open questions (not decided):**
- Home has no pull-up bar, so Pull-Up becomes a second dumbbell row.
- Goblet Squat is tagged kettlebell only, so the home squat becomes a Bulgarian Split Squat.
- Limited machines picks dumbbells over machines.

**Next step:** in the planner (`prototype/index.html`), let the user swap any exercise in a session for one of its catalog alternatives, filtered to the equipment of their chosen setup (`alternatives(id, available)` in `exercises.js`), shown in catalog order. One small, reviewable change with tests for new logic. Propose a plan and wait for approval first (AGENTS.md rule 1).
